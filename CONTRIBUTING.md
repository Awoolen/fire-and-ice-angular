# Contributing

Hey! We absolutely love pull requests and feature suggestions! Before making a pull request for a new feature, we'd like you to open an issue about it first, just to make sure we're on the same page with where we're going. If you'd like to submit a bugfix, please do so! This is the process for getting your changes added:

* If new feature, submit issue asking if it's something we plan to add. If you get approval to work on it, go for it!
* Fork the master branch and make your changes there.
* When you're done, create a pull request.
* When someone's signed off on it, it can be merged.
* You're done!

Try to make sure that everything works before submitting your pull, so there's less work for those of us who are still trying to graduate!

** Code of Conduct

Don't do anything you wouldn't do in front of a six-year-old. Be nice!
